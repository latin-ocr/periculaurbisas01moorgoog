’Twas Syracuse that bid him die, '
Where ost'in highest minstrelsy

His laureate harp had Pindar strung,
And ost the banquet halls had rung ·
Loud with the song-inspired grace ,
That told of Hiero's swift racc,

And welcomed in the enduring lay
The victor os the bloodless bay.

But none of Graecia’s bards e’er shed
The light of song on Nicias' head,

Or let one tunesul teardrop sall

Upon his nameless funeral.

To captive wretch‚ what song is meet?
Who sings to chronicle defeat ἒ-
Enough for him unhnown to lie,

And silence hymn his victory. ¹
