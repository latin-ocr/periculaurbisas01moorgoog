TRANsLATloNS

III.

So wns HE lifted gently from the ground,

And with their height homeward the shepherds move
Through the dull mist, 1 following-when a step,
A single step, that freed me from the skirts

Os the blind vapour, opened to my view,

Glory beyond all glory ever seen

By waking sense, or by the dreaming soul !

The appearance, instantaneously disclosed‚

Was of a mighty City—boldly say

A wilderness of building, sinking far

And sels-withdrawn into a wondrous depth,

Far sinking into splendour—without end!

Fabric it seemed os diamond and os gold,

With alabaster domes and silver spires,

And blazing terrace upon terrace, high

Uplifted ; here, serene pavilions bright,

In avenues disposed; there, towers begirt

With battlements that on their restless fronts Α
Bore stars-illumination of all gems 1

By earthly nature had the effect been wrought ,

Upon the dark materiale of the storrn

Now pacified ; on them, and on the eoves

And mountain-steeps and summits, whereunto

The vapours had receded, taking there

Their station under a caerulean sky.
Wonnswonrn.
