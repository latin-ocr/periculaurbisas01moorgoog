TRANSLATION FROM THE FOURTH ‘AENEID
OF VIRGIL.

’TWAs Night, and creatures of the land and deep
Drank the sweet slumber that the weary sleep.
Now sinks the strise os wood and raging ocean,
Stars in high zenith wheel with noiseless motion.
No voice is heard upon the silent wold

From plumaged birds, or from the slumbering sold:
Whoe’er the tenants os wide gleaming lake,

Or the dark shadows of the bosky brake,

⁵ Couched in deep sleep beneath night's canopy,

And lulled to sweet sorgetsulness they lie.

But not the poor Phoenician. Night's still call
Charms not her eyelids‚ or her bosom’s thrall;
Back on her heart redoubled passions roll,
And Love's returning current floods her soul.

Thus she began and communed with her woe:
Ah! wretch deluded, whither shall Ι go?
Make trial now of those I scomed to wed,
And sue the honour os a Wanderer's bed!

Ah nol embark amidst the crews of Troy,
