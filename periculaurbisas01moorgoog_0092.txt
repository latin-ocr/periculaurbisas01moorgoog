AND POEMS.

And serve 'sor ever in their base employ‚
Because forsooth I helped them in their need,
And Trojan hearts can ne’er sorget the deed.
If thou couldst dare it, what triumphant lord
Will take an alien on his proud shipboard?

Thou know'st not yet, though ruined and alone,

The perjured sons of salse Laomedon.

Shall I with those wild crews unguarded go?
Or press with all my Tyrians on the soe,
Urging once more upon the wind-swept ioam
Men tom unwilling from their Sidon home?
No, die, as thou deservest !—It will sever,

The unflinching steel, thine agony for ever.
’Twas thou, my sister, whom my tears could move
In that mad moment of my rising love,

To plunge me headlong in this depth of woe,
And unprotected hurled me on the foe.

’Twas not sor me to lead the wild-wood lise, Ι
And never know the bondage of a wife,

Nor e’en to keep the promise thati gave .
In the last parting o'er Sychaeus' grave.
