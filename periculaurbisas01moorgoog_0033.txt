SOME iretiul tempers wince at ev’ry touch,

You always do too little or too much:

You speak with life, in hopes to entertain,

Your elevated voice goes through the brain;
You sall at once into a lower key, ·

That’s worse—the drone-pipe of an humblebee.
The southern sash admits too strong a light,
You rise and drop the curtain—now 'tis night.
He shakes with cold-you stir the iire and strive

To make a blaze-that’s roasting him alive.

¹ Serve him with venison, and he chooses iish3
With sole-that’s just the sort he would not wish:
= He takes what he at first professed to loath,
And in due time seeds heartily on both ;

Y et still o’erclouded with a constant srown
He does not swallow, but he gulps it down.
Your hope to please him vain on ev’ry plan,
Himself should work that wonder if he can-—
Alas! his efforts double his 'distress ·

He likes yours little, and his own still less.
Thus always teasing others, always teased,
His only pleasure is-to be displeased.

COWPElt, Conversatiou.
