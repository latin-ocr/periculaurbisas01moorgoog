From Syracuse a sound is sent,

And turret, dome, and battlement
Are ringing with the exulting cry ’
Os paean -chanting victory:

And hermon-lires are smouldering still
On Euryelus’ castled hill,

And high upon Plemmyrium

Bid the Sicilian armies come,

To view the last expiring throe

Os their thrice·baffled captive soe;
And from each inward-gazing glen-
The dread alarm os coming men
Sounds o'er the marsh, where silently
Anapus wanders to the sea;

Or seems to sound: each airy breath

To that doomed army whispers death, Ι

Despair has hushed the piercing cry
That rose from thousands to the sky,
When Syracuse, but yesterday,

With one clear paean swept the bay,

And lorward o’er the drowned and dying
Pressed on their ranks in panic flying‚ ·
As leaves of Autumn pale and sere

Are crowded on the wind-swept mere.
And he stands there, whom Athens sent '
To be the unwilling instrument
