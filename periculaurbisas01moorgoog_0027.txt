IV.

SRONG god of arms! whose iron sceptre sways

The freezing north, and Hyperborean seas,

And Scythian coldS, and Thracia’s winter coast,
Where stand thy steedS, and thou art honoured most ;

There most: but everywhere thy power is known,
The fortune of the fight is all thine own:
Terror is thine, and wild amazement flung

From out thy chariot withers e’en the strong ;

· And disarray and shameful rout ensue,

And force is added to the sainting crew.
Acknowledged as thou art, accept my prayer
If aught I have achieved deserve thy care:
If to my utmost power with sword and shield
I dared the death unknowing how to yield,
And falling in my rank still kept the field:
Then let my arms prevail‚ by thee sustained,
That she Ι love by conquest may be gained.

Dnuouu.
