44 T RANSLA T IONS

· Ο tell her brief is lise, but love is long,
And brief the sun os summer in the north,
And brief the moon of beauty in the south.

O swallow, flying from the golden woods‚
Fly to her and pipe and woo her and make her mine,·
And tell her, tell her, that I follow thee.

TENNYSON, T lze Prz'ncess.
