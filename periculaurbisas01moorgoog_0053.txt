'TRANSLATJONS

· RISEST thou thuS‚ dim dawn, again,
So loud with voices of the birds, ·
So thick with lowings os the herde,
Day, when Ι lost the flower os men;

· Who'tremblest thro’ thy darkling red

On yon swoll'n brook that bubbles fast
By meadows breathing of the past,
And woodlands holy to the dead ;

Who murmurest in the foliaged caves
“ Α song that slights the coming care,

And Autumn laying here and there
A fiery finger on the leaves 3

Who wakenest with thy balmy breath ·
To myriads on the genial earth,
Memories of bridal oros birth,

And unto myriads more, of death.

Ο wheresoever those may be,

Betwixt the slumber os the poleS,
· To-day they count as kindred souls;
They know me not, but mourn with me.

TENNYSON‚ In Memoriam.
