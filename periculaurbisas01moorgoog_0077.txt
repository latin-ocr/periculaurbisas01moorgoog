TRANSLA TIONS

XXIII.

Ecsmsv!

My pulse, as yours doth temperately keep time,

And makes as healthful music: it is not madness
That I have uttered: bring me to the test,

And I the matter will re-word: which madness
Would gambol srom. Mother, sor love of grace
Lay not that flattering unction to your soul,
That not your trespassâ€š but my madness speaks,
It will but skIm and film the ulcerous place,
Whilst rank corruption ruining all withIn

Insects unseen.
Hamlet, Act III. Scene lv
