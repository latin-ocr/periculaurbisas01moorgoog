T RANSLA TIONS

XII.

F AREWELL ! on wings os sombre stain
That blacken in the last blue skies
Thou fly'st3 but thou wilt come again
On the gay wings of butterflies.

Spring on thy approach will sprout
Her new Corinthian beauties out,
Leal-woven homes, where twitter words
Will grow to songs, arrd eggs to birds.
Ambitious buds shall swell to flowers
And April smiles to sunny hours;
Bright days shall be, and gentle nights,
F ull os sost breath and echo lights,

As is the god of suntime kept

His eyes hals open while he slept.
Roses shall be where roses were

Not shadows‚ but reality;

As is they never perished there

But slept in immortality.

Nature shall thrill with new delight,
And Time’s relumined river run

Warm as young blood, and dazzling bright

, Asis its source wes in the Sun.

T. HOOD, T lte Departure of Summer.
