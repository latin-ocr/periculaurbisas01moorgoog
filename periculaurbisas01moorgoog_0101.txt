88 TRANSLATIONS AND POEMS.

While scarlet poppies blush beneath the shade,
And silver lilies decl( the watery glade.

Young HylaS, as he plucks the flowery s'poil,
Forgets his task sor this more pleasing toil:
Next at the spring, all unsuspecting, stays, ι
And in the mirrored reflex loves to gaze;

Then dips his hand a copious draught to drink‚
One shoulder testing on the mossy brink.
’Twas then his beauty fired the nymphs at play
To leave the dance they love, and haste away;

Gently they draw him down the yielding rill;

A little splash-and all around is still.
Afar Alcides calls, his love to save,
But nought save Echo answers from the wave.
