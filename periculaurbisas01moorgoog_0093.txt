NICIAS. ’

rnucrnrnes, vu. 75-8.

O’ER Athens' columned citadels

And green Arcadia's shepherd deils,

O’er Sparta's rock·encircled valley,

And white sails of the bounding galley
That slowa breaks the Ionian foam,
Straining for Hellas and for home,

The Dawn is coming: on the flow

Of Western waves she reddens now,

And bursting upon Sicily

Her trembling purple floods the sky:

But untouched by her rosy fingers

On each dark hill the night-cloud lingers ;
Nor yet the rocks, where dews are streaming,
Upon the precipice are gleaming ;

Nor yet the pines-with sombre dress
Covering the craggy wilderness,

Where never climber dare intrude

On AEtna’s fiery solitude-
