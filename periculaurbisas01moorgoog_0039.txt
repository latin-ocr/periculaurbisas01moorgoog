SHE walks in beauty, like the night
Os cloudless elimes and starry skies,

And all that's best os dark and bright
Meets in her aspect and her eyes,

Thus mellowed to that tendet light
Which Heaven to gaudy day denies.

One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress
And sostly lightens o’er her face,
Where thoughts serenely sweet express
How pure, how dear, their dwelling·place.

And on that cheek, and o'er that brow
So sost, so calm, yet' eloquent,

The smiles that play, the tints that glow
But tell of days in goodness spent,

A mind at peace with all below,· ’ -

A heart whose love is innocent.
