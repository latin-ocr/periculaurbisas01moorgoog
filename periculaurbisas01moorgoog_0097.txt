Round his dear neck their arms are flinging‚
And wildly calling on their love

With eries and tears that may not move,
Till feebly sinking in despair,

They pour to Heaven their latest prayer.

The last sareweli is over now,

And they move sorward, mute and slows¹ Ι

But ever Memory recalls

That voyage from bright Athenian walls,
And hopes that grasped in victory

All treasures of the Western sea;

And then the days which cast their brave
To welter on the harbour wave.

'Or slain in fight, no burial gIven

To lie beneath the unpitying heaven.
And last the flight from that dread shore
To ills perhaps unknown before
O’erpowers them: and the starting tear
Speaks os the woes too hardto bear.

But Nicias' voice is ever by Ι

To cheer their deep despondency.

‘For ills ye cannot now retrieve‚
‘Forbear, my countrymen, to grieve3
‘Forbear the unavailing tear

‘For those beyond the reach of sear.-

‘ The wings os Nemesis which over ·
‘The invading squadron darkly hover,
