V.

Tnnn 1:
‘Follow me, Ο most miserable men l'
And, speaking, I began to foot the waste
Backward, toward the city: all the while
F earing to look behind me, like a man
Wh0, being made against his will to walk
At midnight through a chamel, walks in haste,
Dogged hythe unseen forms of his own fears.
1 saw no cloud ; and yet the winds arose.
The faint light of the unsathomable heavens,
Thick-sown with shivering stars, made the dark plain
Darker. And infinite the darkness seemed.
Sometimes cold gleams from bare gray sepulchres
And ghastly ruins broke the boundless gloom:
Sometimes, upstarting, spectral aqueducts
Ran by us, and plunged headlong down the night:
Far off, at times, the wail of windy reeds
I heard3 and heard, at times, high overhead

The howlet’s cry ; at times, beneath my soot

The cavemous ground gave forth a hollow groan.

R. LYTTON, Parapltrase from K rasinski.
