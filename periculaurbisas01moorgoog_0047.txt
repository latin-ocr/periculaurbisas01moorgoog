X·IV.

WE left behind the painted buoy
That tosses at the harbour mouth,
And madly donced our hearts for joy⁸
As fast we fleeted to the south;
How fresh was every sight and sonnd
On open main or winding shore;
We knew the merry world was round
And we might sail for evernrore.¹

How oft we saw the sun retire‚
And burn the threshold ο1 the night,

Fall from his ocean-lane of stre,
’ And sleep beneath his pillared light.
How ost the purple-skirted robe

01 twilight slowly downward drawn,
As thro’ the slumber os the globe

Again we dashed into the dawn!

New stars all night above the brim
Of waters lightened into view;
They climbed as quickly, for the rim
Changed every moment as we flew ;
Far ran the naked moon across
The houseless oeean’s heaving field,
Or flying shone, the silver boss '

01 her own halo's dusky shield.
