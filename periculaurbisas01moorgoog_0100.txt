TRANSLATION FROM PROPERTIUS.

(ι. 20· η)

STILL runs the tale how Argo left os yore
Thessalia’s docks‚ and straight for Phasis bore.
Scarce had dark Helie’s waters sunk from view,
When Mysia's rocks receive the eager crew;
Stretched on the yielding saud each sinks to rest, ¹
Their sea-worn limbs on leafy couches prest.

But through the woods young Hylas roamed away

To seek the choicer stream that shuns the day;
Him the twin sons of Aquilo pursued‚

Zetes and CalaiS, in wanton moorl3

On swooping pinions see them both essay

To kiss his upturned face and fly away, ·
While-nestling in their wings he’s borne on high,
And waves a bough to soil them as they fly.
Scarce had they ceased, when ah! too luckless sate!
Away goes Hylas where the wood-nymphs wait.
There lies a spring beneath Arganthus’ crest,

A liquid home where Dryads love to rest ;

High arched above the wilti-wood monarchs stand,
With fruits that bloomunreared by human hand,
