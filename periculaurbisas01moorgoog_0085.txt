TRANSLA TIONS

· XXVII.

’ Ocean. HE sunk to the abyss? to the dark void?
Apelle. An eagle 80, caught in some bursting cloud

On Caucasus3 his thunder-baffled wings

Entangled in the whirlwind, and his eyes

Which gazed on the undazzling sun, now blinded

By the white lightning, while the ponderous hail

Beats on his struggling sorm, which sinks at length,

Prone, and the ab'rial ice clings over it.

SHELLEY, Prometheus UnbomuL
