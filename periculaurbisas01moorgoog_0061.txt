TRANSLA T IONS

XVIII.

Now is my love all ready forth to come:

Let all thevirgins therefore well awayt;

And ye fresh boyes, that tend upon her groome,
Prepare your selves ; sor he is coming strayt.
Set all your things in-seemely good array

Fit sor so joyfull day -:

The joyfullst day that ever sunne did see.

Loe where she comes along with portly pace,
Lyke Phoebe from her chamber of the east,
Arysing forth to run her mighty race,

Clad all in white, that seems a virgin best,
So well it her beseemes‚ that ye would weene
Some angell she hed beene.
