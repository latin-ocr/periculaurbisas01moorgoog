Τ RANSLA T IONS

For one sai1 Vision ever fled

Down the waste waters day and night;
And still we followed where she led, .
In hope to gain upon her ssight.

Her face was evermore unseen,
And fixt upon the far sea line ;
But each man murmured ‘O my Queen
· 1 follow till I make thee mine!

TENNYSON, Tlee Voyage.
