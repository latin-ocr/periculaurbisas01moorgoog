T RANSLA TIONS

XXVI.

l MET a traveller from an antique land,

Who said: ‘Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
‘Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand,
‘Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose srown
‘And wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command

‘Tell that its sculptor well those passions read

.‘ Which yet survive, stamped on these lileless things
‘The hand that mock'ed them, and the heart that sed.
‘And oh the pedestal these words appear:

“My name is OzymandiaS, King ol kingS.

“‘ Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair !'’
‘Nothing beside remaius, Round the decay

‘Os that colossal wreck boundless and bare

‘The lone and level sands stretch sar away!

SHELLEY‚ Someet.
