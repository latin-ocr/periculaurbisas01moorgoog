Τ RANSLA Τ IONS

XVI.

Ο SWALLOW, swallow, flying, flying south,
Fly to her, and fall upon her gilded eaveS,
And tell her, tell her, what I tell to thee.

O tell hel, swallow, thou that knowest each,
That bright and fleme and fickle is the south,
And dark and true and tenderis the nosth.

O swallow, swallow, if Ι could follow and light
Upon her lattice, Ι would pipe and trill,
And chirp and twitter twenty million loves.

O were Ι thou that she might take mein
And lay me in her bosom, and her heart
Would rock the snowy cradle, till Ι died.

Why lingereth she to clothe her beart with love,
Delaying as the tender ash delays
To clothe herself, when all the woods are green?

Ο tell her, swallow, that thy brood is flown. ³
Say to her I do but wanton in the south,

But in the north long since my nest is made.
