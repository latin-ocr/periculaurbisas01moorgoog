50 Τ RANSLA TIONS

Her long loose yellow locks lyke golden wyre,

Sprinckled with perle, and perling flowres atweene,

Doe lyke a golden mantle her attyre;
And being crowned with a girland greene,
Seem lyke some mayden queene.
Her modest eyeS, abashed to behold
So many gazers as on her do stare,
Upon the lowly ground affixed are;
Ne dare list up her countenance too bold,
But blush to hear her prayses sung so loud,
So farre from being proude.

· Nathlesse doe ye still loud¹ her prayses sing.
That all the woods may answ'er, and your eccho ring.

SPENSER, Epithalamium.
