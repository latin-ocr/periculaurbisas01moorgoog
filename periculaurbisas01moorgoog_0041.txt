T RANSLA TIONS

XI.

AT the last limits of our isle,

Washed by the western wave,
Touched by thy fate, a thoughtful bard
Sits lonely on thy grave.

Pensive he eyes, before him spread,
The deep outstretched and vast ;

¹ His mourning notes are borne away

Along the rapid blast.

And while, amid the silent dead,

Thy hapless fate he 'mourns

His own long sorrows freshly bleed,
And all his grief returns.

Like thee, cut off in early youth
And flower of beauty's pride,
His friend, his first and only joy,
His much-loved Stella, died.

> Him, too, the stern impulse of Fate

Resistless bears along;
And the same rapid tide shall whelm
The poet and the song.
