BIRI) o! the greenwood
Ο why art thou here?
Leaves dance not o'er thee,
Flowers bloom not near.
All the sweet water
Far hence is at play,
Bird o! the greenwood
Away, away!

Where the mast quivers

Thy place will not be,
As midst the waving
Os wild-rose and tree.
How shouldst thou battle
With storm and with spray.
Bird of the greenwood
Away, away!

Or art thou secking
Some brighter land
Where by the south wind
Vine leaves are fanned?

Midst the wild billow
Why then delay? „

Bird of the greenwood
Away, away!
