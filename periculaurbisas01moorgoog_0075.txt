Vernon. I SAW young Harry, with his beaver on,
His cuisses on his thighs, gallantly armed,
Rise from the ground like feathered Mercury,
And vaulted with such ease into his seat,
As is an angel dropped down srorn the clouds,
To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus
And witch the world with noble horsemanship.

Hotspur. No more, no more: worse than the sun
in March
This praise doth nourish agues. Let them corne:
They corne like sacrifices in their trim,

And to the fire-eyed maid of smoky war
All hot and bleeding will we offer thern.
