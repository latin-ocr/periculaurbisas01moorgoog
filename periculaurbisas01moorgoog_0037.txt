IX.

AND Lo, he sat on horseback at the door!

' And near him the sad nuns with each a light

Stood, and he gave them charge about the Queen,
To guard and foster her sor evermore.

And while he spoke to these his helm was lowered,
To which sor erest the golden Dragon clung

Of Britain; so she did not see the face,

Which then was as an angel’s, but she saw,

Wet with the mists, and smitten by the lights,
The Dragon os ¹ the great Pendragonship

Blaze, making all the night a steam os fire.

And even then he turned; and more and more
The moony vapour rolling round the King,

Who seemed the phantom os a giant in it, ¹
Enwound him sold by sold, and made him gray
And grayer, till himself became as mist

Before her, moving ghostlike to his doom.

anwvsow, Guinevere.
