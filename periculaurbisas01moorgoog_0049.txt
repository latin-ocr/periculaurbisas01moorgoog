TRANSLA T IONS

The peaky islet shifted shapes,

High towns on hilis were dimly seen,
We past long lines oi northern capes,
And dewy northern meadows green.
We came to warmer waves‚ and deep
Across the boundless east we drove,
Where those long swells os breaker sweep
The nutmeg rocks and isles of clove. -

By peaks that flamed, or all in shade
Gloomed the low coast, and quivering brine

With ashy rainS, that spreading made
Fantastic plume or sable pine;

By sands, and steaming flats, and floods
Of mighty mouth we scudded fast,

And hills‚ and scarlet·mingled woods
Gleamed for a moment as we past.

O hundred shores of happy elimes,

How swiftly streamed yeby the bark!
At times the whole sea burned; at times
With wakes of fire we tore the dark:

At times a carven craft would shoot
From havens hid in sairy bowers,

With naked limbS, and flowers and fruit,
But we nor paused sor fruit nor fiowers.
