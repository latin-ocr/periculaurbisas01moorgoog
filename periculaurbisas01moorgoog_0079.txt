Anius. GET you srorn me!
Is not the doom of caesar on this body?
Do 1 not bear my last hour here now sent me?
Am not Ι old Ateius ever-dying?
You think this tenderness and love you bear me,
’Tis treason and the strength of disobedience,
And if ye tempt me further ye shall feel it.
I seek the camp sor safety! when my death,
Ten times more glorious than my life and lasting
Bids me be happy! let the fool sear dying. Ι
Ae'cius is not now to learn to suffer.
ΙΙ ye dare shew a just affection, kill me ;
I wait but those that must. Why do ye weep?
Am 1 so wretched to deserve men's pities?
Go give your tears to those who lose their worthS,
Bewail their miseries: for me wear garlands,
Drink wine, 3ηά much; sing paeans to my praise:
Ι am to triumph, sriendS, and more than Caesar,

For Caesar fears to die: 1 love to die.
