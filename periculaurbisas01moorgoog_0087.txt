' T RANSLA TIONS

XXVIII.

O ΡΚΙΕΝΙ), it seems, when first our lives begin,
When we, fresh mariners, first hoist the sail,
On savouring seas by favouring breezes borne,
As though the bark of our selicity

Could never be ornately trimmed enough,

Nor be enough soll-freighted with delights;

As though each thing we wanted were a wrong
Done to us ;-so we loosen from the land.

But what another lesson will anon

Be learned ; and of them who claimed so much,
Deeming it'all too little sor their needs,

Some will be thankful is one broken plank

Of all their tempest·shattered bark remain,
Bearing them up above the salt-sea foam

Of this world’s infelicity to shore.
