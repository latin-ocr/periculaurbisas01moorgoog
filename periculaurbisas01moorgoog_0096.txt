’ ΛΝΒ POEMS.

Os her ambition’s wildest deed: ' ’
Whose waming voice she would not heed.
But what is years os fight and storm

And pain have matred his wasted form,
Pain that his country heeding not

Still bound him to the soldier's lot,

And what is power and same be fledr-
High Duty’s laws are never dead.

Lit by a flame within the heart,

They brighten never to depart.

’Tis Athens still that fills his sight,

And breathes within the undaunted might
To save the remnant os her host:

While lise remainS, not all is lost

And now another morning shines
Upon their long retreating lineS,
And lond the wail is heard again
From the death-cumbered shore and plain.
Onward with unaverted eyes
’ They pass, where in the gateway lies ¹
The abandoned crowd: they must not see
That last despairing agony; κ ’
Though ost a son's or father’s groan
Is heard in answer to their own.
But others with last hope still strong

Are followingsas they march along;

And to their once-loved comrade clinging
