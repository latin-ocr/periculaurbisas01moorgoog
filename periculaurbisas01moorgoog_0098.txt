AND POEMS.

‘Are soaring nOW, sor she has spent

¹ Her last wrath on our armament,

‘And bears to the Olympian king

‘The tribute os long suffering;

‘Nor can the offended Power deny

‘ To humbled hearts security.

‘Look on yourselves: and chase Despair
‘From out those ranks still firm and fair
‘With discipline; where’er ye g0‚ ·

¹ A city terrifies the soe,

‘Which towers can never sortify

‘As the brave soul and spirit high.

‘E’en now from off her unmanned walls
‘Your own Athene loudly calis

‘Across the intervening main

‘Her sons and city back again.

‘ Her breathing sons! her own dear band,
‘ She calls, the active heart and hand—

‘ And not the hulks that strew yon strand! -

‘Of naval pageantry berest
‘ We, living for our hearths‚ are lest,
‘And pressing on to friendly soil

‘Shall win the end of all our toil.'

A few days, and the cup os death
Has stifled that heroic breath,
Drained in the dungeon house, to sate
Sicilia's triumphant hate.
