XVII.

STILL to be neat, still to be drest,
As you were going to a feast3

Still to be powdered, still persumed:

Lady‚ it is to be presumed,
Though art’s hid causes are not found,
All is not sweet, all is not sound.

Give me a look, give me a face
That makes simplicity a grace ;
Robes loosely flowing, hair as free ;
Such sweet neglect more taketh me
Than all the adulteries of art-

They strike mine eye, but not my heart.

BEN JONSON. -
