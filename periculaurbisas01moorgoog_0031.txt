VI.

SQSPAKE he, half in anger, half in scorn:
And one long cry of grief and of amaze
Broke from his sorrowing people; so he spake;

· And turning, left them there: and with brief pause,
Girt with a throng of revellers, bent his way
To the cool region of the groves he loved.
Tbere by the river banks he wandered on

· From palm-grove on to palm-grove, happy trees,
Their smooth tops shining sunwardS, and beneath
Burying their unsunned stems in grass and flowers;
Where in one dream the severish time of Youth
Might fade in slumber, and the feet of Joy
Might wander all day long and never tire.
Here came the king, holding high feast at mom,
Rose-crowned; and ever when the sun went down

From tree totree, all through the twinkling grove,

A hundred lamps beamed in the tranquil gloom,

Revealing all tlie tumult of the feast,

Flushed guestS, and golden goblets, soamed with wine,
While the deep-burnished foliage overhead
Splintered the silver arrows of the moon.

M. ARNOLD, M ycerz'nus.
