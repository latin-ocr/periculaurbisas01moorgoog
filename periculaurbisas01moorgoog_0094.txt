Pierce through the dense-enfolding mist

That wraps them to the mountain breast:
Only from out the grey profound

Is heard afar the cataract's sound,

As rushing from its aery steep

Onward it dashes to the deep.

But see! before advancing Day .

The morning mists have rolled away;
And colours srom that magic beam

Flash out upon the winding stream, .
And woods in untamed majesty

Toss their bright foliage to the sky,
Where clear above the unnumbered throng
Sweet Philomel begins her song.

But can the light on wood and river
Rekindle hopes now quenched for ever?
The tears that blind the Athenian's eye-
Can they take pleasure from yon sky ,ἓ
Or loves he now the sparkling wave
That rolls above his comrade's grave,
And drists toward the death-strewn shore
Each shattered trireme, mast, and oar,
And bursts in idly soaming spray
F ar· at the entrance of the hay,

Where the chained galleyS, firm and high,
Deny him flight and ,liberty ‚²-
