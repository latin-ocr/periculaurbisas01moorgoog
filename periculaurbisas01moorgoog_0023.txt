TRANSLA T IONS

Il.

BUT the crown
Of all my life was utmost quietude:
More did 1 love to lie in cavern rude,
Keeping in wait whole days sor Neptune’s voice,
And if it came at last, hark and rejoice!
There blush’d no summer eve, but I would steer
My skiff along green shelving coasts to hear
The shepherd's pipe come clear from aery steep,
Mingling with ceaseless bleatings os the sheep.
And never was a day of summer shine
But I beheld its birth upon the brine:
For Ι would watch all night to see unfold
Heaven's gates, and AEthon snort his morning gold
Wide o'er the swelling streams: aud constantly
At brim os day-tide on some grassy lea
My nets would be spread out, and I at rest.

The poor solks of the sea country Ι blest
With daily boon of fish most delicate:
They knew not whence this bouuty‚ and elate

Would strew sweet flowers upon a sterile beach.

KEATS, Endymion.
